What Sessions does?
Under the hood, calling session.add(...) or running a query causes the Session to grab a connection
from the engine, send SQL, and keep track of any objects you're working with.
get_session is a generator just to make a new sessions each time we are using the get_session
function, abd as soon as the request is completed, it closes automatically instead of writing 
db = Session(engine); â€¦; db.close() all the time.
